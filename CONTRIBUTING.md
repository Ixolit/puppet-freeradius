# Contributing

This module was written primarily for internal use - features we haven't needed to
use probably haven't been written. Please send pull requests with new features and
bug fixes. You are also welcome to file issues but I make no guarantees of
development effort if the features aren't useful to my employer.

This module uses Github Actions for testing and validation. Any contributions
must pass tests cleanly, so please ensure you update the tests to match your
contribution.
