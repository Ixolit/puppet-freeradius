  #  status  listen for Status-Server packets.  For examples,

  #  Note: "type = proxy" lets you control the source IP used for
  #        proxying packets, with some limitations:
  #
  #    * A proxy listener CANNOT be used in a virtual server section.
  #    * You should probably set "port = 0".
  #    * Any "clients" configuration will be ignored.
  #
  #  See also proxy.conf, and the "src_ipaddr" configuration entry
  #  in the sample "home_server" section.  When you specify the
  #  source IP address for packets sent to a home server, the
  #  proxy listeners are automatically created.

  #  IP address on which to listen.
  #  Allowed values are:
  #  dotted quad (1.2.3.4)
  #       hostname    (radius.example.com)
  #       wildcard    (*)

  #  Some systems support binding to an interface, in addition
  #  to the IP address.  This feature isn't strictly necessary,
  #  but for sites with many IP addresses on one interface,

  #

  #  get an error if you try to use it.

  #  Per-socket lists of clients.  This is a very useful feature.
  #
  #  The name here is a reference to a section elsewhere in
  #  radiusd.conf, or clients.conf.  Having the name as
  #  a reference allows multiple sockets to use the same
  #  set of clients.
  #
  #  If this configuration is used, then the global list of clients
  #  is IGNORED for this "listen" section.  Take care configuring
  #  this feature, to ensure you don't accidentally disable a
  #  client you need.
